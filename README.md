# Solutions to UVa Online Judge problems

This repository contains solutions to [UVa Online Judge][1] problems, available at [http://uva.onlinejudge.org][1]. Theses solutions are provided "as is". I give no guarantees that they will work as expected. 

## Install (Under development - not working)

You can compile a specific problem, issue the following command, replacing `<problem_id>` with the section and id of the problem you want to compile, see section "Problem Solved" for the list of possible ids:

	$ make <problem_id>

Running a compiled problem is just a matter of executing a command similar to the next one, replacing `100` with the id of the desired problem:

	$ ./100

Unless stated otherwise, every problem in this repository reads from the standard input and writes to standard output.
